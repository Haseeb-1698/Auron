# Note: These are placeholder SVG-based icons
# In production, replace with proper PNG icons

Icon placeholders created. To use real icons:
1. Create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Use a shield or security-themed design
3. Name them icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
4. Place in the icons/ directory

For development, you can generate icons using:
- Online tools like favicon.io
- Design software like Figma or Adobe Illustrator
- Icon generators for browser extensions
